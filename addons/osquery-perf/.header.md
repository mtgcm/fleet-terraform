# osquery-perf addon
This addon adds osquery-perf hosts to the Fleet installation.
These are generally used for loadtesting or other testing purposes.  See https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/tree/main/cmd/osquery-perf to learn more about osquery-perf itself.

This addon:
1. Creates an AWS Secrets Manager secret that will be used to store the enroll secret that the osquery-perf hosts use to enroll into Fleet. AND
2. Optionally takes a string, `enroll_secret` (string), to create an AWS Secrets Manager secret version, in the AWS Secrets Manager Secret created by the addon. If not specified directly to the module, the secret will need to have its `SecretString` populated with the enroll secret manually once everything is setup in order for the osquery-perf hosts to connect. OR
3. Optionally takes a AWS Secrets Manager secret ARN, `enroll_secret_arn` (string), for an already existing Secrets Manager secret.

If both an `enroll_secret` and an `enroll_secret_arn` are defined, the module will prioritize the `enroll_secret_arn`.
If neither an `enroll_secret` or an `enroll_secret_arn` are defined, the module will create a placeholder secret, you will need to add a `secret_version` manually and `terraform apply` one more time.

Below is an example implementation of the module:

```
module "osquery_perf" {
  source                     = "github.com/fleetdm/fleet-terraform//addons/osquery-perf?ref=tf-mod-addon-osquery-perf-v1.2.0"
  customer_prefix            = "fleet"
  ecs_cluster                = module.main.byo-vpc.byo-db.byo-ecs.service.cluster
  subnets                    = module.main.byo-vpc.byo-db.byo-ecs.service.network_configuration[0].subnets
  security_groups            = module.main.byo-vpc.byo-db.byo-ecs.service.network_configuration[0].security_groups
  ecs_iam_role_arn           = module.main.byo-vpc.byo-db.byo-ecs.iam_role_arn
  ecs_execution_iam_role_arn = module.main.byo-vpc.byo-db.byo-ecs.execution_iam_role_arn
  server_url                 = "https://${aws_route53_record.main.fqdn}"
  osquery_perf_image         = local.osquery_perf_image
  extra_flags                = ["--os_templates", "mac10.14.6,ubuntu_22.04,windows_11"]
  logging_options            = module.main.byo-vpc.byo-db.byo-ecs.logging_config
  # Optional - One of enroll_secret or enroll_secret_arn can be used, but neither are required. 
  #            If neither are passed in, you will need to populate the secret version manually, 
  #            in the secret that is created by the addon.
  # enroll_secret            = "mGNJvwKhs4PIa6ZNxMiXqqBfXKO67n2Y"
  # enroll_secret_arn        = "arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<account-id>:secret:<secret-name>"
}
```
